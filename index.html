                The best thing to ever come out of the estate is the mosque located at the entrance of the estate. The building of the mosque started in 2017 and was completed in 2020 Alhamdulillah. Now the estate has its very own mosque and also its very own committee headed by sh.Mohamud Salat ,may Allah preserve him and all other committee members of the mosque.
